# Recruitment {#recruitment}

Welcome to the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at UNH!

![](img/forestgump.gif)

Please explore this lab manual and the [lab website](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/). If you are still interested in joining the lab, read deails below submit an interest form.

## All members

All lab members must:

- Be decent human beings (we don’t work with jerks)
- Have an interest in ecological systems and using quantitative tools (e.g., mathematical models, statistics, R)
- Want to change the world

Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory tower. One of my main commitments as a faculty member is promoting and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Please consider applying for a position in my lab if you are a first-generation college student, a student from a low-income background, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, if you identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or if you have a disability.


## Undergraduate students

We are not currently actively recruiting undergraduate students. However, you can still put in a general inquiry below. 

The lab often has openings for undergraduate students to contribute to projects or design a project for an undergraduate thesis/research experience. All students are paid or receive course credits. These projects are typically co-designed by the student, QMEL graduate students, and Professor Easton White. The undergraduate researcher role in the lab is more detailed in the [lab handbook](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/lab-manual/06-training-undergrads-and-interns.html).

We take applications at any time, but interns typically start in January, June, or August. There are UNH student specific opportunities, but we also have openings for non-UNH students and recent graduates. The students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen interest in developing quantitative skills in the context of marine systems.

If you are interested in joining the lab, head to [link](https://forms.office.com/r/sAbUJvMiRv) to complete an interest survey and send a brief email to [qmel.admin@unh.edu](mailto:qmel.admin@unh.edu).


## Graduate students

I will likely accept 1-2 students (MS or PhD) in Fall 2026. Students could work on a variety of projects, including the mathematical modeling of aquaculture or decision science related to how to optimize ecological monitoring programs. The applicant would be expected to have a strong data science or mathematical modeling background. Applicants that will be the most competitive for a position will have experience (and willingness to learn more) with R and quantitative skills (e.g., mathematical modeling, statistics). After completing this head to this [link](https://forms.office.com/r/sAbUJvMiRv) to complete an interest survey and send a brief email to [qmel.admin@unh.edu](mailto:qmel.admin@unh.edu). It is important to emphasize why you are interested in working in my lab specifically. I am also open to chatting about the topics above or potential projects related to other areas of my research program. 

Our [lab handbook](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/lab-manual/) is a living document and lays out expectations of lab members. 

I can accept students through [UNH's Biological Sciences MS and PhD programs.](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) There are specific programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although less common, I can also accept student through the [Oceanography](https://ceps.unh.edu/earth-sciences/academics), [Natural Resources & Earth Systems Science](https://gradschool.unh.edu/natural-resources-earth-systems-science-phd), and [Integrated Applied Mathematics](https://ceps.unh.edu/integrated-applied-mathematics/academics) programs at UNH. If you are interested in working with me, I strongly recommended that you reach out to me before applying for graduate study. Graduate work is typically funded through a combination of fellowships, research positions, and teaching assistantships. For students starting in Fall 2025, the minimum yearly salary is $31,520 per year (including summer). The salary increases each year and is higher if you already have a MS degree. Health insurance and tuition are also covered by the lab/university. When we make an offer to a graduate student, their funding is described in detail in an offer letter. 

I encourage my own students and applicants to apply for [various grants and fellowships](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/lab-manual/12-grants.html). I can help applicants apply for these opportunities.

The curriculum in the biology graduate programs is flexible. Graduate students work with their advisor and committee to choose a set of courses. In my lab, it is common for students to take a mix of the following courses in their first two years. All incoming students take BIOL 901: Introductory Graduate Seminar. BIOL 901 is designed for you to build community within your cohort and learn about UNH.

- BIOL 806: Data Science with R for the Life Sciences
- BIOL 895: Theoretical Ecology
- OE 895: Marine Ecosystem Modeling
- NR 807: Environmental Modeling
- BIOL 902: Scientific Writing
- NR 905: Grant Writing
- NR 909: Multivariate Statistics
- NR 913: Hierarchical modeling and Bayesian Statistics
- ANFS 933: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Experiments


Depending on your specific interests, I might not be the best advisor for you at UNH. You may also want to reach out to others in the [Biology Department](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/people) or within the [College of Life Science And Agriculture](https://colsa.unh.edu/). 




## Postdoctoral fellows

We are currently recruiting a postdoc with a Fall or Jan start date ideally. The project involves using secondary data (e.g., eBird, BioTime) to investigate questions related to the optimal design of long-term monitoring programs. The applicant is expected to have a strong background in data science or mathematical modeling. If desired, the postdoc would also mentor and/or teach as part of the appointment. 

I am also open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent postdoctoral fellow positions through several different programs.
