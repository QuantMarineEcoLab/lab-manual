## Funding

Like publications, funding is an important metric in science. Applying
for and receiving funding allows us to do interesting science, but it
also will help you in your career. As a lab member, you are expected to
apply for grants to support research and travel as well as fellowships
that may advance your career. This helps both you and the lab as a
whole. Although youâ€™ll lead these applications, you can also expect
meaningful contributions from Easton throughout the process. This means
enough lead time is critical. In addition, you may occasionally be asked
to add comments or contribute a figure to a grant proposal that Easton
is working on. In addition, you are always welcome to read grants that
Easton has worked on or submitted.

As a lab, we have compiled a database of funding opportunities that are
the most relevant to members of this lab (see shared Google Drive).
