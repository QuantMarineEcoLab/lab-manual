# Lab culture and philosophy {#culture}

## Guiding principles

There are several guiding principles that form the basis of my outlook
as a scientist which also inform my approach to leading a lab.
Throughout this lab manual, I will come back to these themes.

1.  Work-life balance
2.  Vulnerability and openness
3.  Transparency
4.  Tracking progress
5.  Antiracist principles
6.  Embrace failure - failing often is the key to success
7.  Celebrate and support one another
8.  Produce high quality science
9.  Communicate early and often
10. Backwards design
11. Produce science that can be used (stakeholder engagement, popular
    press)

## General expectations

### Big picture

Science can be hard, frustrating, and even sometimes painful (like when
my appendix ruptured in the field!). However, the process of science can
also be filled with joy, discovery, and collaboration. As a lab, it is
key that we work together to create an environment that is conducive to
productive, honest, and healthy science. We do not buy into [myths that
one has to work 80 hours a
week](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/you-do-not-need-to-work-80-hours-a-week-to-succeed-in-academia/)
or that you have to be cutthroat to succeed. With that in mind, there
are a few big picture thoughts that are important for this lab (many of
which are very different from other labs you may have been a part of):

-   You should be working on problems that excite you. This doesn’t mean
    every step of the process will be exciting, but following your
    curiosity is a tried-and-true path to creating interesting and
    impactful science.
-   We have to be very careful and honest about the science we produce.
    I am not a famous PI at some fancy school. When we produce
    groundbreaking or novel work, people will not take our word for it
    (and nor should they!). We have to be sure of the work we produce
    and own up to mistakes when they happen.
-   Some of science is done on an individual business, but it is also
    highly collaborative. This is especially true in QMEL. When someone
    in the lab succeeds, we all succeed. Be kind and help one another.
-   If you are struggling professionally or personally, it is important
    to seek help. This can be from Easton, your fellow lab mates,
    friends, family, or professionals. Easton sees a therapist
    frequently as a check on his mental health.
-   A research lab is similar to a small business. As the lab PI, I am
    the entrepreneur and CEO. One of my main responsibilities is to
    provide overall direction and to bring in work (via grants).
    However, because we are a small group, there should be a relatively
    flat hierarchy in the lab. This research lab will only be successful
    if we work together.
-   Research funding and publications are two commonly used metrics of
    success in science. This is problematic in many ways, but it is how
    things are. This doesn’t mean that we can’t work on other things
    (e.g., science outreach), but funding and publications still have to
    happen.
-   Each semester, we will reflect as a group and in one-on-one
    discussions on upcoming goals of the lab. This is meant as a way to
    track our progress towards goals and reduce ambiguity. We are not
    aiming to accomplish 100% of our goals. Ideally, we will only
    accomplish 70-80% of our goals each semester to ensure our goals are
    achievable, but lofty. We also keep the idea of backwards design in
    our planning process on order to help us achieve our long-term
    goals.
-   A critical part of being a lab member is attending events in the
    department, on campus, and beyond the university. Events can include
    casual coffee breaks, job candidate talks, scientific lectures, and
    social hours. All of these events provide an important opportunity
    for both your own career and to build a culture of community.

### Small picture

-   If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you
    need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick.
-   You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and
    you aren’t expected to stay late at night (Easton rarely works
    during these times). You are expected to get your work done
    (whatever time of day you like to do it).
-   Show up and be on time for meetings.
-   Keep the lab spaces clean and tidy

### Taking time off

In order to maintain your mental health and productivity, it is
essential to take time off. For this reason, all full-time lab members,
including the PI, are guaranteed 20 paid days off. The lab PI
appreciates when you let him know you won’t be in, but you are welcome
to take time off for any reason. You don’t need to take time off for a
scientific conference (related to your graduate work) or for holidays.
There is no need to formally track your time off. There may also be days
where your work isn’t going particularly well. You should feel empowered
to leave work early and take care of yourself. In this lab, we are
worried about long-term productivity versus how much time you spend on
any given day doing work.



## Communication

One of the most important aspects to being successful in this lab, UNH,
and elsewhere is clear, early, and frequent communication. Early
communication can save everyone a lot of headaches later on. We have
several platforms for communication.

### Weekly lab meetings

Each week, we will meet as an entire lab. At the beginning of each
semester, we will decide on lab meeting objectives and goals. This can
include topics like professional development, practice talks, reading
and discussing papers, general check ins (including our mental health),
or collaborative lab projects.

### Weekly one-on-one meetings

The lab PI will meet weekly with each member of the lab unless a
different agreement has been reached. I expect these meetings to be led
by the advisee, not me. These weekly meetings are a way for you to keep
me updated on your progress and to get input. I expect agendas going
into each meeting and notes written afterwards in order to make our time
together effective. This is your primary time to get my input on a
regular basis.

### Unscheduled communication

I am typically on campus from 9am-5pm Mon through Friday. However, my
time is split between being working in my office, attending meetings, or
teaching classes. When I am in my office, I may or not be available to
chat. I often have “deep work” sessions where I am trying to concentrate
and focus on thinking hard thoughts. During these times, or if I am on a
call, my door will be closed. When my door is open, you are welcome to
stop in for a quick chat. Anything longer than a few minutes may require
setting up a formal time to chat.

### Sharepoint Kanban board

To [manage projects in the lab](https://universitysystemnh.sharepoint.com/teams/QuantMarineEcologyLab/Lists/QMEL%20Projects/Kanban%20View.aspx), we use a [Kanban-style board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board). The key is to have a central place for each project to keep track of communication, files, and updates. Otherwise, we spend a lot of effort trying to find files and communication in shared folders, emails, and Slack. 

Each project has a card on the board. The board includes column to signify the status of each project. A project is often at the scale of a student chapter, paper, or grant. The card scope shouldn't be too big (e.g., complete PhD disseration), but it also shouldn't be too small (e.g., edit equation in methods). For smaller tasks, these could live on a separate board or spreadsheet to track all the details on an individual project.

Each card has information on who is responsible for what and by when. The cards allow sharing of links to important documents and back and forth communcation. Using a @ symbol notifies someone you have an update for them.

## Lab Slack team

The lab group uses Slack <https://qmel.slack.com/> as one of our main
communication tools. It is a useful way to celebrate our achievements
together virtually, share interesting articles or papers, coordinate
collaborations, and organize meetings. This helps remove some email
clutter.

## Email

We don’t use email a lot in the lab. We use email to collaborate with non-lab members or to share documents back and forth.

## Texting and phone calls

I use texting and phone calls sparingly. They are best for quick one
one-off messages (e.g., “For our meeting, let’s meet at the coffee shop
instead”) or in case you really need something urgently (e.g., “I’m
locked out of the building”). Conversations that require a lot of back
and forth are often handled best in a quick in-person meeting.

## Science workflow

Each scientist, lab, and field has their own set up favorite tools and
technologies that allow them to actually do science. This ranges from
what software to write papers to statistical software to field
equipment. Below is a brief description of how the scientific workflow
currently operates in the QMEL. A shared set of tools and approaches
helps us ultimately make more progress as a group.

### Programming (R, R markdown, and Github)

Our lab is a leader in open and reproducible science. This means that
every member of the lab will use tools such as R, R markdown, and
Github. These tools allow us to reproducible workflows and make our work
more accessible to others. Where possible, each paper should be written
in R markdown (and/or LaTex) and tracked using version control in
Github. Sometimes this workflow is not possible given outside
collaborators that may not be comfortable with these tools. Google docs
can work as a substitute in these cases.

### File storage and sharing

The lab primarily uses Sharepoint. We use Sharepoint for large file storage and backing up data. Sometimes, we use Google drive for collaborating on documents, especially with external
co-authors. For manuscripts written by only members of QMEL, the preference for document preparation is a combination of R markdown (or Quarto) and Github.

When collecting new data (and also useful when downloading data from elsewhere), ensure you have several backups. There should be 1 copy on Sharepoint, 1 on your local machine, and 1 on an external drive. 

### Working on papers

The style of the lab is to share outlines and drafts of manuscripts
early and often. This allows Easton or others to make comments early on
in the process which might save a lot of headaches later. When you have
a version, you would like Easton to read, simply let him know that you
would like feedback and try to specify by when and for what you
specifically want feedback with (e.g., structuring the introduction,
figure design, etc.). Every grant and paper needs to be read by one
other lab member and Easton before submission.

### Reference manager

You are free to use whatever reference manager you prefer, but most
people in the lab use Zotero. It is free, integrates with R markdown and
Google docs, and allows collaborations among many people.

### Social media

The lab has a Twitter (<https://twitter.com/quantmarineeco>) that is maintained by the lab PI, but it hasn't been used in a while. 

### Lab website

An updated lab website (<https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/>) is
important for public engagement and sharing our work with others. As a
member of the lab, you are expected to contribute to the lab website
from time to time. This includes a biography of yourself, project
updates (usually in the form of blog posts), and posting papers. Details
of how to contribute to the website are on the website’s Github page
(<https://github.com/quantmarineecolab>).
