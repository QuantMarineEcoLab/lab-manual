    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This is the lab manual for the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nOur work focuses on how to use quantitative tools to understand marine systems. We have three core lab themes: improving environmental monitoring, understanding how ecosystems respond to extreme events, and how to improve environmental data science education. More about our group can be found on our website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the lab. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document (see Edit this page to the right. As a lab member, you should have push access and not need to fork the repo) in order to help future lab members. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or contact Easton (easton.white@unh.edu). QMEL lab members can also provide anonymous feedback here.\nWherever possible, this document includes links to other resources and documents on campus. This is to reduce overlap in effort and to keep everything up to date. Here are two of the most important:\n\nUNH Graduate School\nDBS Grad Student Handbooks - parts of these feel out of date\n\nQMEL has had a lab manual since its inception, but we used this template from the Fay Lab starting in 2025. They built it as part of the Openscapes Champions program.\n\n\n &lt; link to this book’s GitHub repository.

    "text": "3.2 General expectations\n\n3.2.1 Big picture\nScience can be hard, frustrating, and even sometimes painful (like when my appendix ruptured in the field!). However, the process of science can also be filled with joy, discovery, and collaboration. As a lab, it is key that we work together to create an environment that is conducive to productive, honest, and healthy science. We do not buy into myths that one has to work 80 hours a week or that you have to be cutthroat to succeed. With that in mind, there are a few big picture thoughts that are important for this lab (many of which are very different from other labs you may have been a part of):\n\nYou should be working on problems that excite you. This doesn’t mean every step of the process will be exciting, but following your curiosity is a tried-and-true path to creating interesting and impactful science.\nWe have to be very careful and honest about the science we produce. I am not a famous PI at some fancy school. When we produce groundbreaking or novel work, people will not take our word for it (and nor should they!). We have to be sure of the work we produce and own up to mistakes when they happen.\nSome of science is done on an individual business, but it is also highly collaborative. This is especially true in QMEL. When someone in the lab succeeds, we all succeed. Be kind and help one another.\nIf you are struggling professionally or personally, it is important to seek help. This can be from Easton, your fellow lab mates, friends, family, or professionals. Easton sees a therapist frequently as a check on his mental health.\nA research lab is similar to a small business. As the lab PI, I am the entrepreneur and CEO. One of my main responsibilities is to provide overall direction and to bring in work (via grants). However, because we are a small group, there should be a relatively flat hierarchy in the lab. This research lab will only be successful if we work together.\nResearch funding and publications are two commonly used metrics of success in science. This is problematic in many ways, but it is how things are. This doesn’t mean that we can’t work on other things (e.g., science outreach), but funding and publications still have to happen.\nEach semester, we will reflect as a group and in one-on-one discussions on upcoming goals of the lab. This is meant as a way to track our progress towards goals and reduce ambiguity. We are not aiming to accomplish 100% of our goals. Ideally, we will only accomplish 70-80% of our goals each semester to ensure our goals are achievable, but lofty. We also keep the idea of backwards design in our planning process on order to help us achieve our long-term goals.\nA critical part of being a lab member is attending events in the department, on campus, and beyond the university. Events can include casual coffee breaks, job candidate talks, scientific lectures, and social hours. All of these events provide an important opportunity for both your own career and to build a culture of community.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Small picture\n\nIf you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick.\nYou aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night (Easton rarely works during these times). You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).\nShow up and be on time for meetings.\nKeep the lab spaces clean and tidy\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Taking time off\nIn order to maintain your mental health and productivity, it is essential to take time off. For this reason, all full-time lab members, including the PI, are guaranteed 20 paid days off. The lab PI appreciates when you let him know you won’t be in, but you are welcome to take time off for any reason. You don’t need to take time off for a scientific conference (related to your graduate work) or for holidays. There is no need to formally track your time off. There may also be days where your work isn’t going particularly well. You should feel empowered to leave work early and take care of yourself. In this lab, we are worried about long-term productivity versus how much time you spend on any given day doing work.",

    "text": "3.3 Communication\nOne of the most important aspects to being successful in this lab, UNH, and elsewhere is clear, early, and frequent communication. Early communication can save everyone a lot of headaches later on. We have several platforms for communication.\n\n3.3.1 Weekly lab meetings\nEach week, we will meet as an entire lab. At the beginning of each semester, we will decide on lab meeting objectives and goals. This can include topics like professional development, practice talks, reading and discussing papers, general check ins (including our mental health), or collaborative lab projects.\n\n\n3.3.2 Weekly one-on-one meetings\nThe lab PI will meet weekly with each member of the lab unless a different agreement has been reached. I expect these meetings to be led by the advisee, not me. These weekly meetings are a way for you to keep me updated on your progress and to get input. I expect agendas going into each meeting and notes written afterwards in order to make our time together effective. This is your primary time to get my input on a regular basis.\n\n\n3.3.3 Unscheduled communication\nI am typically on campus from 9am-5pm Mon through Friday. However, my time is split between being working in my office, attending meetings, or teaching classes. When I am in my office, I may or not be available to chat. I often have “deep work” sessions where I am trying to concentrate and focus on thinking hard thoughts. During these times, or if I am on a call, my door will be closed. When my door is open, you are welcome to stop in for a quick chat. Anything longer than a few minutes may require setting up a formal time to chat.\n\n\n3.3.4 Sharepoint Kanban board\nTo manage projects in the lab, we use a Kanban-style board. The key is to have a central place for each project to keep track of communication, files, and updates. Otherwise, we spend a lot of effort trying to find files and communication in shared folders, emails, and Slack.\nEach project has a card on the board. The board includes column to signify the status of each project. A project is often at the scale of a student chapter, paper, or grant. The card scope shouldn’t be too big (e.g., complete PhD disseration), but it also shouldn’t be too small (e.g., edit equation in methods). For smaller tasks, these could live on a separate board or spreadsheet to track all the details on an individual project.\n\nEach card has information on who is responsible for what and by when. The cards allow sharing of links to important documents and back and forth communcation. Using a @ symbol notifies someone you have an update for them.",

    "text": "3.7 Science workflow\nEach scientist, lab, and field has their own set up favorite tools and technologies that allow them to actually do science. This ranges from what software to write papers to statistical software to field equipment. Below is a brief description of how the scientific workflow currently operates in the QMEL. A shared set of tools and approaches helps us ultimately make more progress as a group.\n\n3.7.1 Programming (R, R markdown, and Github)\nOur lab is a leader in open and reproducible science. This means that every member of the lab will use tools such as R, R markdown, and Github. These tools allow us to reproducible workflows and make our work more accessible to others. Where possible, each paper should be written in R markdown (and/or LaTex) and tracked using version control in Github. Sometimes this workflow is not possible given outside collaborators that may not be comfortable with these tools. Google docs can work as a substitute in these cases.\n\n\n3.7.2 File storage and sharing\nThe lab primarily uses Sharepoint. We use Sharepoint for large file storage and backing up data. Sometimes, we use Google drive for collaborating on documents, especially with external co-authors. For manuscripts written by only members of QMEL, the preference for document preparation is a combination of R markdown (or Quarto) and Github.\nWhen collecting new data (and also useful when downloading data from elsewhere), ensure you have several backups. There should be 1 copy on Sharepoint, 1 on your local machine, and 1 on an external drive.\n\n\n3.7.3 Working on papers\nThe style of the lab is to share outlines and drafts of manuscripts early and often. This allows Easton or others to make comments early on in the process which might save a lot of headaches later. When you have a version, you would like Easton to read, simply let him know that you would like feedback and try to specify by when and for what you specifically want feedback with (e.g., structuring the introduction, figure design, etc.). Every grant and paper needs to be read by one other lab member and Easton before submission.\n\n\n3.7.4 Reference manager\nYou are free to use whatever reference manager you prefer, but most people in the lab use Zotero. It is free, integrates with R markdown and Google docs, and allows collaborations among many people.\n\n\n3.7.5 Social media\nThe lab has a Twitter (https://twitter.com/quantmarineeco) that is maintained by the lab PI, but it hasn’t been used in a while.\n\n\n3.7.6 Lab website\nAn updated lab website (https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/) is important for public engagement and sharing our work with others. As a member of the lab, you are expected to contribute to the lab website from time to time. This includes a biography of yourself, project updates (usually in the form of blog posts), and posting papers. Details of how to contribute to the website are on the website’s Github page (https://github.com/quantmarineecolab).",

After completing this, head to this link to complete an interest survey and send a brief email to qmel.admin@unh.edu. It is important to emphasize why you are interested in working in my lab specifically. I am also open to chatting about the topics above or potential projects related to other areas of my research program.\nOur lab handbook is a living document and lays out expectations of lab members.\nI can accept students through UNH’s Biological Sciences MS and PhD programs. There are specific programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although less common, I can also accept student through the Oceanography, Natural Resources & Earth Systems Science, and Integrated Applied Mathematics programs at UNH. If you are interested in working with me, I strongly recommended that you reach out to me before applying for graduate study. Graduate work is typically funded through a combination of fellowships, research positions, and teaching assistantships. For students starting in Fall 2025, the minimum yearly salary is $31,520 per year (including summer). The salary increases each year and is higher if you already have a MS degree. Health insurance and tuition are also covered by the lab/university. When we make an offer to a graduate student, their funding is described in detail in an offer letter.\nI encourage my own students and applicants to apply for various grants and fellowships. I can help applicants apply for these opportunities.\n\nSimons Graduate Fellowships in Ecology and Evolution - new funding source for PhD students in ecology/evolution with quantitative background - proposal due July 31st, 2025, so get in touch ASAP\nQuad fellowship - $20,000 award for graduate students. Due in March each year.\nFulbright Program - this is for non-US residents to study and work in the US - due in October (depends a bit on the country) each year\nNSF GRFP - Award is for three years of funding - lots of restrictions on who can apply - due in October each year\nPaul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans - Due in November each year\nNOAA-NMFS Population Dynamics Fellowship - The fellowship can provide support for up to three years for highly qualified graduate students working towards a Ph.D. in quantitative programs\nHertz Fellowship - Fellowships to PhD students in the applied physical and biological sciences, mathematics, or engineering - due in October each year\nGillam Fellows Program - program to advance equity and inclusion in science.

Graduate students work with their advisor and committee to choose a set of courses. In my lab, it is common for students to take a mix of the following courses in their first two years (see below for a couple of examples). All incoming students take BIOL 901: Introductory Graduate Seminar. BIOL 901 is designed for you to build community within your cohort and learn about UNH.\n\nBIOL 806: Data Science with R for the Life Sciences\nBIOL 895: Theoretical Ecology\nOE 895: Marine Ecosystem Modeling\nNR 807: Environmental Modeling\nBIOL 902: Scientific Writing\nNR 905: Grant Writing\nNR 909: Multivariate Statistics\nNR 913: Hierarchical modeling and Bayesian Statistics\nANFS 933: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Experiments\n\nDepending on your specific interests, I might not be the best advisor for you at UNH.

    "text": "7.2 Expectations\nUndergraduates play a critical role in QMEL. The lab has several ongoing research projects led by either Professor White or another senior member of the lab (including graduate students and postdocs). Undergraduates interested in working in the lab should have a genuine interest in the research questions and be interested in developing quantitative (e.g., math, statistics, computer programming) skills.\nResearch Phases: There are three phases at which undergraduates can be involved in research within QMEL. The different phases represent different levels of research experience, independence, and responsibility. Most students start as research assistants. Not all students move through all three levels of involvement.\n\nResearch Apprentice: The first stage of involvement for an undergraduate is as a research apprentice. At this stage, an undergraduate joins a research team in the lab. The goal is to get caught up on the current progress of the team. This includes reading scientific papers, learning necessary tools (e.g., R programming), and meeting regularly with team members. This phase continues until Professor White and the research team agree the student is ready to become a more active and contributing member to the lab. This phase typically last one semester or year.\nResearch Assistant: Following their apprenticeship, students are expected to contribute in more significant ways to the research team. This can involve collecting and analyzing data, manuscript writing, conducting experiments, and so forth. The goal during this phase is to present work at a scientific conference or submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\nResearch Associate: The final phase of involvement in the lab is for students who have presented their work at a conference or been involved in the submission of a manuscript (see above). This phase involves more leadership and independence. Students at this level define team goals, help mentor new team members, and meet regularly with Professor White. This phase in the lab is very similar to being a graduate student in the lab.\n\nDuring your time as an undergraduate researcher in the QMEL, you will have several responsibilities:\n\nSend mentors weekly email updates on Fridays by 5pm describing briefly what you’ve been working on, what you plan to do the following week, and any questions or troubles you had. Important things to include: projects you’ve worked on, broken equipment, storage/equipment conflicts, if your data looks weird.\nKeep weekly notes, especially of meetings with mentors.\nPrepare a monthly blog post of what you are working on.\nAttend lab meetings. The entire lab assembles approximately once a week to discuss our research. Generally, the person leading the lab meeting will distribute reading materials in advance. You should read these materials and come prepared to participate actively in the discussion.\nMaintain a lab notebook and stay organized. There is a lot of overlap in projects, and it is essential that you keep track of your work. This includes updating the data spreadsheets and lab notebooks immediately. Someone else should be able to step into your role at any moment and be able to get up to speed quickly.\nRead background literature. A key part to your development as a scientist\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate. Many of the issues that arise in research are simply because of a lack of communication. It is critical that you communicate early and often on issues or concerns that you may be experiences.\nBe independent. I am periodically away, and I expect you to get things done well without me. Ask questions when I am around, but don’t be afraid to try to do the detective work on your own if I am not. We have a helpful, experienced lab, so know that folks other than me may be excellent resources.\nKeep up with your other responsibilities. As an undergraduate, you have many other obligations. This can include coursework, jobs, family, and more.",

    "text": "8.1 Committees\nGraduate school is designed to help make you a more independent scientist. In the QMEL, graduate students are expected to co-develop their projects with the lab PI as opposed to being handed a specific project. This freedom can be GREAT, but it can also make you feel adrift at times. That is okay and it is expected. Especially early in graduate school, you should be spending a significant portion of your time reading, taking classes, attending talks, and meeting others. The goal is to think broadly and come up with interesting questions.\nThe goal of graduate school is not to get a degree. The goal is to learn how to think critically, learn skills, and to get the job you want after graduation. My goal as an advisor is to help you accomplish these things. Early and often communication is key to a strong advisor-advisee relationship. I have to know when you need help in order for me to be a good advisor.\nDuring your time as a grad student in the QEML, you will have several responsibilities:\nThere is clearly a lot to being a graduate student. It can sometimes be difficult to know where to spend your time, which is your most precious resource. I use the term backwards design (which I’ve stolen from research on pedagogy) to overcome this problem. The key is to think about where you want to be after graduate school. Do you want to be a professor? Then it will be important to publish, get funding, and teach courses in graduate school. Do you want to work on science policy? Then it will be important to publish, work with local officials, and apply for opportunities related to policy. Meetings with Easton and others in the lab or on campus will help clarify some of these choices.\nIn order to be successful as a scientist, it is critical that you stay up to date on the latest research. This can be a formidable challenge but it can be facilitated by using RSS feeds or emails with journal table of contents. Setting up Google Scholar alerts can also be helpful for specific key words. You can also consider following scientists or scientific organizations on Twitter.",

    "text": "8.2 Academics\nSpecific requirements of MS and PhD students depend on whether they are enrolled in Marine Biology or Integrative Bioloy. These requirements are updated more regularly in internal departmental documents. The goal here is lay out requirements, coursework, and timelines more specific to QMEL. There are also details about requirements at the Graduate School level available.\nLearning outcomes of a graduate degree from QMEL\n\nTBD\nTBD\n\nKey competencies\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 MS program\n\n8.2.1.1 MS proposal\n\n\n8.2.1.2 MS defense\nStudents typically defend their MS about one month from the end of the term in which they plan to graduate (e.g., a defense in early April if trying to graduate in May). The graduate school actually requires this earlier defense date. Students then typically have about a month to address any comments that come out of the defense.\nOne of the most exciting and nerve-wracking times of a graduate program is your defense day. The day is a mix of celebration and often difficult discussions.\nScheduling your defense: 4-6 weeks before the defense\nThe day of the defense: Be sure to show up to the room early to test equipment and to get situated. Despite you wanting to focus on the defense itself, everyone who enters the room will want to say something to you to show their support. Easton will speak for a few minutes to introduce you and the plan for the day. You will then have 30-40 minutes to present your work. Your presentation will then be followed by 10-20 minutes of questions.\nThere will be a weird mix of emotions after the hour-long public defense. Friends and family will congratulate you. You should spend time soaking it in. You have successfully passed ½ of the defense. You’ll have a moment to breath or go to the restroom before transitioning to the private defense (usually in a separate, smaller room).\nIn the private defense, Easton will explain the format and plan for the private defense. The defense will start with each committee member asking a few questions (10-15 minutes) before the next committee member starts. Once every committee member has had a chance to ask questions, we will open the discussion for anyone to ask additional questions. Easton will take notes to let you focus on answering questions.\nAfter about 30-90 minutes of questions and discussion, the committee will ask that you leave the room. Walk down the hall, take a breath, but don’t go too far. We will come get you after 5-10 minutes of discussion. You will then join the committee and Easton will share the consensus decision of the whole group. There are three options.\n\nFail (extremely unlikely as Easton wouldn’t let you defend if he thought this was a possibility)\nNeed major revisions before passing (the most common option)\nPass with minor revisions (it happens, but isn’t super common)\n\nIf the consensus is number (2) above (which is the most likely), Easton and the committee will provide a blueprint for what needs to happen before they can sign up on your thesis/dissertation.\nYou should take a moment to collect your thoughts, write down any notes, and breath. Usually, you and Easton will have a minute to chat. The goal is to wrap up the thoughts for the day and take a break. Once you have captured any important ideas, put your thesis and notes away. In a few days, return to the notes. You and Easton will make a plan at this point to finish and address committee concerns. In the meantime, spend time with family and friends, eat, sleep, relax, etc. You need a break after a day full of emotion.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 PhD program\nResponsible Conduct of Research\nAs a land-­grant institution, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is accountable to New Hampshire residents and to the University community to ensure the ethical and safe conduct of research and scholarly activity. As an institution of higher education that prides itself on extensive research endeavors and the involvement of undergraduates and graduate students in research projects, UNH has an obligation to teach and actively promote integrity in research and scholarship.\nTo fulfill its obligations, UNH has embarked on a program on the responsible conduct of research and scholarly activity (RCR) to:\n\nRaise the consciousness of faculty, staff, and students regarding the ethical and responsible conduct of research and scholarly activity;\nEstablish a knowledge base that defines normative and/or professional behavior to assist faculty, staff, and students in making ethical and responsible decisions in the conduct of research and scholarly activity; and\nFoster an institutional culture of integrity in research and scholarly activity.\n\nTo support these efforts, the Graduate Council has mandated that all incoming Ph.D. students complete RCR training approved by the Graduate School by the end of their first semester. For more information, visit the RCR website.\n\n8.2.2.1 PhD proposal\nAt the end of year one or early in year 2 (by the end of year 2 at the latest), you are expected to formally defend your PhD proposal. The proposal is an opportunity to formalize your PhD plan and receive feedback from the committee. Your PhD path will surely change along the way, so the proposal is exactly that—a proposal. Proposals in QMEL tend to be more detailed than those in other labs. In particular, we write propoosals in “manuscript format” where each chapter is described with an introduction and methods section.\nThere is some information on the PhD proposal available here for current students. Here are a few key considerations:\n\nAll thesis proposals are limited in length to the signature coversheet plus 20 or fewer double-spaced, single-sided or double-sided, numbered pages in a font size no smaller than 12 point. Proposals longer than this will not be accepted, however, appendices and references are not included in the 15-page limit, and must be numbered separately, using lower-case Roman numerals.\nEach chapter must be outlined in the style of a manuscript with a short introduction (including statement of problem and justification for work), clear objectives, and methods that clearly address the objectivs.\nA clear demonstration of knowledge of the literature with appropriate sources is important.\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2 PhD Qualifying Exam\nThe committee should be provided with the research proposal ahead of time, because this will shape what they decide is important to cover in the qualifying exams. Questions about the proposal are highly appropriate as part of the oral exam. The qualifying exam typically happens at the end of year 2 or the start of year 3. If the qualifying exam has not been completed by the end of year 3, a student may be placed on probation.\n\n8.2.2.2.1 Outline of process for qualifying exams (written and oral components):\n\nThe Student schedules dates for the (a) written and (b) oral portions of the exam\nThe written portion does not require committee members’ presence. It should be completed in time for committee members to review answers before the oral, around two weeks in advance.\nThe oral portion requires all members’ participation (in person or via zoom).\nUse meeting schedulers like when2meet or doodle to identify a two-hour block that works for the oral exam. It is advised you schedule this far in advance, ideally when your committee members have their schedules for the next semester (2-3 months is ideal).\nThe Student chooses three areas of specialization in consultation with her committee\nDiscuss and agree in advance whether the exam is open- or closed-book, time limits, and expected length of written answers (usually 2-5 pages each)\nCommittee members each submit 2-3 possible questions to Easton, who selects and provides them to The Student on the agreed date(s) – often, one question per day within a single week\nThe Student answers selected questions in essay form and returns those answers to Easton\nEaston circulates all answers to all committee members\nOral exam: about 2 hours\nCommittee members take turns asking The Student questions (including but not limited to the written exam and research proposal; general knowledge in relevant areas is also appropriate/fair game)\nThe Student leaves the room and the committee decides whether she has earned a pass, conditional pass (needs to re-do some portion of the exam), or fail.\nShe comes back, we tell her the decision, and go on from there.\nOnce she has passed the exam, The Student fills out paperwork, Easton signs it, and it goes to Lisa Buchalski and thence to the graduate school. This includes nominating her Doctoral Dissertation Committee, which may look a lot like her current Guidance Committee.\nThere are two forms\nGrad school Doctoral Candidacy form (only GPC and advisor sign)\nDBS Comprehensive Exam form (all committee members must sign)\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2.2 Advice for qualifying exams\nThe candidacy/qualifying/comprehensive exam can seem intimidating. It will require you to take at least one month off your typical routine (maybe longer if you need to TA or have other commitments) to prepare. However, as long as you study you will pass. Easton and your committee will not have agreed to you scheduling Comps if they didn’t think you would be ready.\nScheduling – Ideally, you will pass your Comps before the end of your fifth semester. Work backwards and figure out how much time you will need to schedule both orals and written exams and study. You will need to propose to your committee that you are ready to take Comps, ideally during a committee meeting so that your progress is fresh in their minds and you have a captive audience. Bonus points if you can make everyone take out their calendars during the meeting and schedule the orals then and there! If you need to email your committee instead, account for how long it will take for everyone to 1) agree that you are ready for Comps and 2) agree on a date and time. Ideally, do this 2-4 months in advance.\nFocal areas and Reading list– When planning on your study schedule, you should plan on doing all of your prep work before your writtens, not your orals. You will want to take a breahter/refocus a bit in between your writtens and orals, and having to play catchup is not ideal.\nAround 6-8 weeks before your written exam week, write to each committee member to determine 1) what areas of focus they should question you on, and 2) suggested reading lists given these focal areas. Focus areas should be tailored to each committee member’s main disciplines and how they intersect with your work. You can start off with a list you and Easton decide on, and then see what they think. Along with the focal areas, you should solicit a reading list from your committee members. This reading list can be an enormous help in your studying, as the textbooks/review papers/seminal papers they suggest are likely to be different from the reading you’ve been doing for your proposal and individual experiments. They should send you somewhere between 5-15 resources.\nHow to study – At least 4-6 weeks before your written exam date, you should have all meetings organized, reading material acquired, and focus areas agreed upon. Organization of your readings and notes is critical and highly personal – use what has worked for you historically. Notetaking programs like Notion and OneNote are highly customizable and use a reference manager to organize your resources (ideally in a separate “comps” folder). If it is helpful to you, calculate how many papers/pages you need to read a day – this will help you break down the intimidating stack of reading!\nGiven the time limits you have during your written and oral exams, having a good recall of 1) what a certain paper is about (i.e. Levin and Paine 1974 is about disturbances in intertidal communities…) and 2) what papers you can cite or refer to on a given subject (Metabolic Theory of Ecology originated from 1997 West, Brown, and Enquist paper). They are not going to ask you about methodological details (generally), or a specific result. Instead, you should focus on the major conclusions, theories, patterns, models, trends, etc. That are discussed in each paper. This is why you will find yourself reading more review papers, textbooks, synthesis papers, etc. Than you probably normally do.\nTake notes, ideally both in the text of each paper and in a single document/program so that you can easily refer back to all your notes later.\nMy master’s advisor once told me to follow the 6-6-6 rule… start studying six weeks before your exam date, six days a week, six hours a day. I don’t think working six days a week is at all necessary, but this structure can give you a general clue for how much time you should be spending.",

    "text": "11.1 Advice on writing\nFor better or worse, publications are a key currency in science. They are one of the main ways we track scientific progress and individual production. Authorship on papers can be one of the most fraught topics and is therefore often ignored until the last minute. This is a bad strategy and only leads to resentment among co-authors. Therefore, authorship (in terms of composition and order) should be determined at the onset of the project. The specifics might change throughout the project, but it is key to have a starting point to work with from the start. The term “significant scientific contributions” is often used for defining who should be included as an author. In this lab, we use the definition from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html): The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria:\nThus, simply providing some data or providing minor comments on a manuscript do not warrant authorship, but they should still be acknowledged. Just because I am your advisor, does not mean I warrant authorship on your publications. The same goes for your committee members. There will likely be publications that you are involved with that I have only a small part in. That being said, the most common order (but by no means the only) for authorship in the lab is Grad Student Lead, Other Contributors, with the PI as the last author. It is common for the grad student lead and the PI to both be corresponding authors.\nKey principles on writing in the lab\nHere are some examples of the last bullet:\nAs an academic, you are also now a professional writer. You get paid to think of ideas, test them, and then write about your findings. Writing can be one of the most important aspects of being a scientist, but it can also lead to a lot of pain. Why? Writing is hard by its nature. It is not natural and is a skill you have to develop and keep working on. I still read lots of books on writing and attend workshops. I also work with professional editors to help improve my own writing.\nYou have to write consistently. Ideally, you would write every day for a set duration (say 30-60 minutes). I write a lot, not because I am a great writer, but because I am a consistent writer. If you write just 100 words per day, but 5 days a week, over the course of a year you’ll have produced 26,000 words. You don’t want to arrive to the end of your degree program or finish a bunch of analyses only to then start writing. You should be writing throughout the process. When I was ready to defend my PhD, I essentially stapled three papers together, used material from my proposal written years earlier to form the intro, and I then had a dissertation. There was no mad dash as the end to finish all the writing. I had done it already.\nHow do you improve your writing? First, you have to write a lot. Second, you can read the work of others and take notes on the writing style. Why do you like how one paper is written compared to another? The best writers are also prolific readers. Third, you need to receive lots of feedback on your writing from me, your colleagues, and writing coaches/editors. On a given paper, I would expect us to go back and forth on 10+ drafts (even more with co-authors). The writing process is slow for this reason.\nUNH writing resources\nhttps://gradschool.unh.edu/student-resources/career-professional-community-development-resources/writing-research\nAll grad students can see a writing coach up to 8 times a semester!!

    "section": "11.2 Where to publish",
    "text": "11.2 Where to publish\nA lot has been written on this topic. In general, we like to publish our work open access (which may be in the form of a preprint) and solid journals. The goal is to publish in the right journal as opposed to the “best journal possible”. One useful tip is to go through your list of references. What journals do you cite? That probably gives you a good clue as to the write audience for your work.\nAt UNH, we have a special agreement with Cambridge to publish open access for free, including in the following journals.\n\nEnvironmental Data Science\nOryx\nCoastal Futures\nEnvironmental Conservation\n\nWe also publish for free, or cheaply, in PeerJ and UNH enjoys other publishing discounts.\n\n11.2.1 Submitting a paper\nThroughout the process of developing a paper for publication, you should also think about what journals you plan to submit to, who the co-authors will be, and when you want to submit. The answers to these questions will shape how you write the paper.\nEarly in the development of a manuscript, you should have a target journal, determine the focus of the journal, and discuss with Easton or other senior authors. At this stage, you should have an ideal of the author list (and likely order) as well. It is important to sort out authorship very early in the process.\nAt least 2-3 months prior to submission, you should have a full draft of the paper. After a round of revisions with the senior author(s), usually Easton, you can then get feedback from other co-authors.\nAt least a month prior to submission, you should send the draft paper to all co-authors. You can do this in rounds, or send to everyone at once, but you should give every co-author at least three weeks to provide feedback. You should tell them a specific date by which you need their feedback.\nIn addition to your co-authors, at this stage you should seek internally—often called “friendly” peer review. Before submission, all papers must be internally peer reviewed by a minimum of 2 QMEL lab members at the same level or higher than your current career stage. For example, if you are a graduate student, you can have your paper draft read by two other graduate students or a graduate student and a postdoc. This is an important step as co-authors can often be too close to the work and may miss important details.\nIt is also useful to create an account at the journal you intend to submit. You can start the submission process to ensure you know what is expected from the journal. Each journal will also have an Author Guidelines document (see below for MEPS example).\nA week prior to submission, you should be incorporating edits from co-authors and discussing with the QMEL senior author on the paper. A week before submission, you should also email all co-authors to tell them that you plan to submit within a week and to ask if anyone objects to the final version of the manuscript. You should also tell them you plan to submit as a preprint if that applies to you.\nFor submission, you need to carefully follow journal requirements. It is wise to review these requirements and create an author account with the journal well before you need to submit. These are outlined clearly on every journal website. Some journals require line numbers, a cover letter, a link to data, etc. You will almost certainly need to come up with a short list (usually 3-5 names) of potential paper reviewers to suggest. An editor won’t choose everyone on your list, but they often start there. You cannot suggest someone you have published with previously.\n## Authorship resources\n\nhttp://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2010/04/conventions-scientific-authorship\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2021/05/how-navigate-authorship-scientific-manuscripts\n\nHere is some other advice on submitting papers\nhttps://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/publication-recognition/how-to-submit-a-paper-for-publication-in-a-journal/\nhttps://medium.com/(aschrock/how-to-submit-a-journal-article-48bbca709c70?)\n\n\n11.2.2 Acknowledgements (example with lots of details)\nThe authors would like to thank Josie DeMerit and Ella Williams for their assistance completing the laboratory experiments.

    "text": "14.2 Funding\nLike publications, funding is an important metric in science. Applying for and receiving funding allows us to do interesting science, but it also will help you in your career. As a lab member, you are expected to apply for grants to support research and travel as well as fellowships that may advance your career. This helps both you and the lab as a whole. Although you’ll lead these applications, you can also expect meaningful contributions from Easton throughout the process. This means enough lead time is critical. In addition, you may occasionally be asked to add comments or contribute a figure to a grant proposal that Easton is working on. In addition, you are always welcome to read grants that Easton has worked on or submitted.\nAs a lab, we have compiled a database of funding opportunities that are the most relevant to members of this lab (see shared Google Drive).\n\n14.2.1 Types of Funding\n\n14.2.1.1 TA-ship\nTeaching Assistants are hired to assist faculty in teaching undergraduate courses. Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to: classroom management and pedagogy, presentation of selected lectures, group discussion leadership, class organization and management tasks, and identification/organization of class resources. Teaching Assistants are mentored by faculty and receive constructive evaluative feedback concerning their pedagogy and teaching skills.\nTeaching assistants are expected to work no more than 20 hours per week. There could be an odd week here or there (e.g., during an exam week) that could be above 20, but other weeks should then be under 20 hours per week. If your hours are substantially under or at all over 20, please chat with Easton and the instructor of the course. No one should be having you serve as a TA for more than 20 hours a week.\n\n\n14.2.1.2 RA-ship\nResearch Assistants are hired to assist faculty in research projects related to the faculty member’s area of expertise and research agenda. Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to: reviewing the literature, identify knowledge gaps, developing original research questions and survey instrumentation, data collection, data analyses and statistics, technical writing, peer-reviewed scientific writing, and refereed research presentations. Research Assistants are mentored by faculty and receive constructive evaluative feedback concerning their technical and research skills.\nA research assistantship can take a lot of different forms in the lab. A RA-ship during the academic year supports 20 hours per week of “research” time with the remaining 20 hours for your studies, coursework, etc. In the summer, all students are guaranteed 50% support (which is the same rate as you’re paid during the academic year). It is possible to get additional summer salary as well.\nIn general, there are probably three different RA-ship scenarios within QMEL. Expectations should be set at the beginning of each semester between each student and Easton.\nThe RA funds come from a grant that directly supports your graduate research (e.g., NSF grfp). The grant could be in the form of a grant or fellowship you apply for or from Easton\nThe RA funds come from a project unrelated to your work. Here, you would be spending 20 hours a week working on some project with the remaining time dedicated to your own work and studies.\nA mix of the above\nFor example:\nIn 2024, Drew was on an RA-ship funded by a grant we received from the NH Agricultural Experimental Station. Drew spent about half of his time on research directly related to his dissertation and the other half on other work related to the grant. In this case, Drew was mentoring other students and setting up a field survey.\nIn Summer 2023, Sophie was funded by two sources: a grant related to a project on lumpfish (unrelated to her thesis) and a fellowship she won. In that summer, she split her time between the two projects. Thus, the lumpfish project paid for some of her time even if it was unrelated to her thesis work.\nIn Fall 2024, Selina had an RA ship through one of Easton’s grants. She spent 10-20 hours a week working on building biosensors, a project that wasn’t directly tied to her thesis. The rest of her time was focused on courses and her own research.\nDuring Fall 2024, Miguel was funded by a fellowship he won, the Fulbright. Thus, he is able to focus full time on his PhD work without being asked to do a lot of other lab responsibilities (e.g., lab or field work on other projects). He still attends lab meetings and is a good QMEL citizen, but most of his time is focused on research\nA student with their own funding* (e.g., Fulbright**, GRFP, STAF) has the most flexibility to focus their time on their own research projects. For example, if you were on a GRFP, Easton wouldn’t be allowed to ask you to work substantively on another project or TA.\nI would expect a student on an RA-ship to be more productive and more willing to help labmates that are on a TA-ship and are thus more limited in their own time.\n*Note. Scholarships usually come with their own terms and caveats. An agreement is made between UNH and the funding scholarship institution, but the grantee must keep track of paperwork and requirements from both institutions. Some scholarships come with tuition fee waivers, others expect grantees to apply for additional funding or have personal funds available. Scholarships rarely offer a summer stipend. Scholars MUST be full-time students (cover 9 credits each semester) for UNH to validate student benefits such as health insurance, regardless of the scholarship terms and support.\n**Fulbright Scholarship. Some students like Miguel, Salvador and Sophie have been Fullbright Scholars. Fulbright offers a fixed amount deposited in a couple installments through the academic year. Scholars must give proof of funding covering cost of living and tuition estimates for their state. The scholarship will be reduced if the scholar receives funding from other sources. The only exception is what is called a “top-off award” given by the University or PI to match the scholar stipend to the minimum cost of living.\n### Funding Breakdowns\nSummer funding models:\nEveryone is paid 50% time (around $7,500) each summer. The funding could be for your own work, but it could also be to help on other lab projects.\nIf a student receives a grant, they can add it to their own summer salary\nIf a student receives a grant, they can add some percent to summer salary where the rest would go to paying for overhead\nWe collate all students grants and then distribute equally\nLet’s assume scenario 3.\nA STAF fellowship is $5,000 each summer. We could bump up a student salary to $9,600 (standard summer salary plus half of STAF). The remaining $2,500 would go to paying for other things in the lab\nSuppose a student gets a grant for $14,000 to their project. A student could apply the grant to bump them up by to full-time in the summer. Thus, they would make 7,000 from QMEL and 7,000 from their grant with the remaining 7,000 from the grant going back to cover QMEL expenses\nIf a student received a $2,000 grant from SMSOE (or something similar), I could envision two scenarios:\nIf unrestricted, then $1,000 would go to bumping up salary and another $1,000 would go to lab expenses\nIf restricted to no salary, $2,000 could go to lab expenses, which may allow Easton to then bump up a student’s salary by $1,000 anyway\nIf scenario 3, then we could have a diversity of salaries in the lab, despite everyone working a lot\n7,100 (50% time)\n14,000 (100% time) – grad student would need to bring in a grant of at least 14K to cover 50% of their top up with the rest going towards lab\n15 or 16K - NSF GRFP (or other fellowship) that goes to covering full salary",
