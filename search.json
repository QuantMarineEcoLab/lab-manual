    "text": "1 Welcome!\n\n\n\n\n\n This is the lab manual for the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nOur work focuses on how to use quantitative tools to understand marine systems. We have three core lab themes: improving environmental monitoring, understanding how ecosystems respond to extreme events, and how to improve environmental data science education. More about our group can be found on our website.\nThe purpose of this document is to help ensure a more seamless transition into the lab. The document is a living document and is by no means exhaustive. The goal is simply to try and get members of the lab on the same page and to help you be successful. You are encouraged to make additions and edits to this document in order to help future lab members. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please add a New Issue or contact Easton (easton.white@unh.edu). QMEL lab members can also provide anonymous feedback here.\nWherever possible, this document includes links to other resources and documents on campus. This is to reduce overlap in effort and to keep everything up to date. Here are two of the most important:\n\nUNH Graduate School\nDBS Grad Student Handbooks - parts of these feel out of date\n\nQMEL has had a lab manual since its inception, but we used this template from the Fay Lab starting in 2025. They built it as part of the Openscapes Champions program.\n\n\n &lt; link to this book’s GitHub repository.

    "text": "7.2 Expectations\nUndergraduates play a critical role in QMEL. The lab has several ongoing research projects led by either Professor White or another senior member of the lab (including graduate students and postdocs). Undergraduates interested in working in the lab should have a genuine interest in the research questions and be interested in developing quantitative (e.g., math, statistics, computer programming) skills.\nResearch Phases: There are three phases at which undergraduates can be involved in research within QMEL. The different phases represent different levels of research experience, independence, and responsibility. Most students start as research assistants. Not all students move through all three levels of involvement.\n\nResearch Apprentice: The first stage of involvement for an undergraduate is as a research apprentice. At this stage, an undergraduate joins a research team in the lab. The goal is to get caught up on the current progress of the team. This includes reading scientific papers, learning necessary tools (e.g., R programming), and meeting regularly with team members. This phase continues until Professor White and the research team agree the student is ready to become a more active and contributing member to the lab. This phase typically last one semester or year.\nResearch Assistant: Following their apprenticeship, students are expected to contribute in more significant ways to the research team. This can involve collecting and analyzing data, manuscript writing, conducting experiments, and so forth. The goal during this phase is to present work at a scientific conference or submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\nResearch Associate: The final phase of involvement in the lab is for students who have presented their work at a conference or been involved in the submission of a manuscript (see above). This phase involves more leadership and independence. Students at this level define team goals, help mentor new team members, and meet regularly with Professor White. This phase in the lab is very similar to being a graduate student in the lab.\n\nDuring your time as a undergraduate researcher in the QEML, you will have several responsibilities:\n\nSend me weekly email updates on Fridays by 5pm describing briefly what you’ve been working on, what you plan to do the following week, and any questions or troubles you had. Important things to include: projects you’ve worked on, broken equipment, storage/equipment conflicts, if your data looks weird.\nAttend lab meetings. The entire lab assembles approximately once a week to discuss our research. Generally, the person leading the lab meeting will distribute reading materials in advance. You should read these materials and come prepared to participate actively in the discussion.\nMaintain a lab notebook and stay organized. There is a lot of overlap in projects, and it is essential that you keep track of your work. This includes updating the data spreadsheets and lab notebooks immediately. Someone else should be able to step into your role at any moment and be able to get up to speed quickly.\nRead background literature. A key part to your development as a scientist\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate. Many of the issues that arise in research are simply because of a lack of communication. It is critical that you communicate early and often on issues or concerns that you may be experiences.\nBe independent. I am periodically away, and I expect you to get things done well without me. Ask questions when I am around, but don’t be afraid to try to do the detective work on your own if I am not. We have a helpful, experienced lab, so know that folks other than me may be excellent resources.\nKeep up with your other responsibilities. As an undergraduate, you have many other obligations. This can include coursework, jobs, family, and more.",

    "text": "TBD\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 MS program\n\n\n8.1.2 PhD program\n\n8.1.2.1 PhD proposal\nAt the end of year one or early in year 2, you are expected to formally defend your PhD proposal. The proposal is an opportunity to formalize your PhD plan and receive feedback from the committee. Your PhD path will surely change along the way, so the proposal is exactly that—a proposal. Proposals in QMEL tend to be more detailed than those in other labs. In particular, we write propoosals in “manuscript format” where each chapter is described with an introduction and methods section.\nMORE HERE\n\n\n8.1.2.2 PhD Qualifying Exam\nThe committee should be provided with the research proposal ahead of time, because this will shape what they decide is important to cover in the qualifying exams. Questions about the proposal are highly appropriate as part of the oral exam. The qualifying exam typically happens at the end of year 2 or the start of year 3. If the qualifying exam has not been completed by the end of year 3, a student may be placed on probation.\n\n8.1.2.2.1 Outline of process for qualifying exams (written and oral components):\n\nThe Student schedules dates for the (a) written and (b) oral portions of the exam\nThe written portion does not require committee members’ presence. It should be completed in time for committee members to review answers before the oral, around two weeks in advance.\nThe oral portion requires all members’ participation (in person or via zoom).\nUse meeting schedulers like when2meet or doodle to identify a two-hour block that works for the oral exam. It is advised you schedule this far in advance, ideally when your committee members have their schedules for the next semester (2-3 months is ideal).\nThe Student chooses three areas of specialization in consultation with her committee\nDiscuss and agree in advance whether the exam is open- or closed-book, time limits, and expected length of written answers (usually 2-5 pages each)\nCommittee members each submit 2-3 possible questions to Easton, who selects and provides them to The Student on the agreed date(s) – often, one question per day within a single week\nThe Student answers selected questions in essay form and returns those answers to Easton\nEaston circulates all answers to all committee members\nOral exam: about 2 hours\nCommittee members take turns asking The Student questions (including but not limited to the written exam and research proposal; general knowledge in relevant areas is also appropriate/fair game)\nThe Student leaves the room and the committee decides whether she has earned a pass, conditional pass (needs to re-do some portion of the exam), or fail.\nShe comes back, we tell her the decision, and go on from there.\nOnce she has passed the exam, The Student fills out paperwork, Easton signs it, and it goes to Lisa Buchalski and thence to the graduate school. This includes nominating her Doctoral Dissertation Committee, which may look a lot like her current Guidance Committee.\nThere are two forms\nGrad school Doctoral Candidacy form (only GPC and advisor sign)\nDBS Comprehensive Exam form (all committee members must sign)\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2.2 Advice for qualifying exams\nThe candidacy/qualifying/comprehensive exam can seem intimidating. It will require you to take at least one month off your typical routine (maybe longer if you need to TA or have other commitments) to prepare. However, as long as you study you will pass. Easton and your committee will not have agreed to you scheduling Comps if they didn’t think you would be ready.\nScheduling – Ideally, you will pass your Comps before the end of your fifth semester. Work backwards and figure out how much time you will need to schedule both orals and written exams and study. You will need to propose to your committee that you are ready to take Comps, ideally during a committee meeting so that your progress is fresh in their minds and you have a captive audience. Bonus points if you can make everyone take out their calendars during the meeting and schedule the orals then and there! If you need to email your committee instead, account for how long it will take for everyone to 1) agree that you are ready for Comps and 2) agree on a date and time. Ideally, do this 2-4 months in advance.\nFocal areas and Reading list– When planning on your study schedule, you should plan on doing all of your prep work before your writtens, not your orals. You will want to take a breahter/refocus a bit in between your writtens and orals, and having to play catchup is not ideal.\nAround 6-8 weeks before your written exam week, write to each committee member to determine 1) what areas of focus they should question you on, and 2) suggested reading lists given these focal areas. Focus areas should be tailored to each committee member’s main disciplines and how they intersect with your work. You can start off with a list you and Easton decide on, and then see what they think. Along with the focal areas, you should solicit a reading list from your committee members. This reading list can be an enormous help in your studying, as the textbooks/review papers/seminal papers they suggest are likely to be different from the reading you’ve been doing for your proposal and individual experiments. They should send you somewhere between 5-15 resources.\nHow to study – At least 4-6 weeks before your written exam date, you should have all meetings organized, reading material acquired, and focus areas agreed upon. Organization of your readings and notes is critical and highly personal – use what has worked for you historically. Notetaking programs like Notion and OneNote are highly customizable and use a reference manager to organize your resources (ideally in a separate “comps” folder). If it is helpful to you, calculate how many papers/pages you need to read a day – this will help you break down the intimidating stack of reading!\nGiven the time limits you have during your written and oral exams, having a good recall of 1) what a certain paper is about (i.e. Levin and Paine 1974 is about disturbances in intertidal communities…) and 2) what papers you can cite or refer to on a given subject (Metabolic Theory of Ecology originated from 1997 West, Brown, and Enquist paper). They are not going to ask you about methodological details (generally), or a specific result. Instead, you should focus on the major conclusions, theories, patterns, models, trends, etc. That are discussed in each paper. This is why you will find yourself reading more review papers, textbooks, synthesis papers, etc. Than you probably normally do.\nTake notes, ideally both in the text of each paper and in a single document/program so that you can easily refer back to all your notes later.\nMy master’s advisor once told me to follow the 6-6-6 rule… start studying six weeks before your exam date, six days a week, six hours a day. I don’t think working six days a week is at all necessary, but this structure can give you a general clue for how much time you should be spending.",
