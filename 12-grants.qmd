# Conference and Travel Funding
* **SMSOE Travel and Education Support Program**
This program is intended to provide partial travel support to present the results of marine science and ocean engineering research at regional, national, and international meetings. Support is available to all School faculty, graduate students, and staff with a strong preference given to graduate students. This program also provides educational support. These requests are treated similarly to travel requests. Application should be submitted at least 30 days prior to travel. For information about available funding, limitations, and application instructions, [click here](https://marine.unh.edu/opportunities/travel-education-funding).
* **Graduate School Travel Grant**
The Graduate School is pleased to announce that travel grants are available to assist graduate students presenting papers and poster sessions at professional meetings and conferences. Travel grants are also available to students who are attending professional development workshops and seminars that will enhance their research agendas. No more than two travel grants per academic year (fall to summer) will be awarded to each individual, who must be a current graduate student at the time of the application and travel. Travel grants will not exceed $200 per student per conference, or $400 per student per academic year. Students seeking a travel grant must make a request for one prior to the date of their conference or meeting. [Info Here](https://www.gradschool.unh.edu/php/travel_grant.php) and [Request Form Here](https://gradschool.unh.edu/admissions/financial/travel-grant-request-form).

# Specific Undergraduate Funding
* **Undergraduate Research Presentation Grants**
Over the years, dozens of UNH undergraduates have presented their research findings at conferences and professional meetings nationwide. If you are invited to present at an off-campus venue, you may apply to the Hamel Center for Undergraduate Research for a Research Presentation Grant. These grants support your travel expenses and conference registration fees (not including meals, lodging, or trip insurance).  Award amounts vary based on available funds. [Info Here](https://www.unh.edu/undergrad-research/research-presentation-grants).
* [Doyle Undergrad Fellowship](https://seagrant.unh.edu/fellowships/doyle-fellowship). New Hampshire Sea Grant's Brian E. Doyle Undergraduate Marine Extension Fellowship offers motivated undergraduates from a range of backgrounds a paid opportunity to work on projects and receive hands-on training and mentorship from NH Sea Grant staff and partners each summer. The fellowship is intended for students who are interested in connecting coastal and marine-related research to extension, education, and communications activities. 
* [Various undergrad research programs through UNH's Hamel Center](https://www.unh.edu/undergrad-research/programs)
* [UNH Center for Coastal Ocean Mapping Summer Undergrad Research Fellowship](https://ccom.unh.edu/surf). Students accepted into the program will spend up to 10 intensive weeks (normally early June to mid-August) working under the guidance of a CCOM faculty member. They will conduct research related to acoustics, bathymetric mapping, habitat mapping, lidar, marine geology and geophysics, optical imaging, sonar signal processing, or data visualization. Research activities may include laboratory experiments, field work, a research cruise, data analysis, model development, or instrument development.
