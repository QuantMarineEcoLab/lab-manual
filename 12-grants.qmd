# Conference and Travel Funding
* **SMSOE Travel and Education Support Program**
This program is intended to provide partial travel support to present the results of marine science and ocean engineering research at regional, national, and international meetings. Support is available to all School faculty, graduate students, and staff with a strong preference given to graduate students. This program also provides educational support. These requests are treated similarly to travel requests. Application should be submitted at least 30 days prior to travel. For information about available funding, limitations, and application instructions, [click here](https://marine.unh.edu/opportunities/travel-education-funding).
* **Graduate School Travel Grant**
The Graduate School is pleased to announce that travel grants are available to assist graduate students presenting papers and poster sessions at professional meetings and conferences. Travel grants are also available to students who are attending professional development workshops and seminars that will enhance their research agendas. No more than two travel grants per academic year (fall to summer) will be awarded to each individual, who must be a current graduate student at the time of the application and travel. Travel grants will not exceed $200 per student per conference, or $400 per student per academic year. Students seeking a travel grant must make a request for one prior to the date of their conference or meeting. [Info Here](https://www.gradschool.unh.edu/php/travel_grant.php) and [Request Form Here](https://gradschool.unh.edu/admissions/financial/travel-grant-request-form).
* **Undergraduate Research Presentation Grants**
Over the years, dozens of UNH undergraduates have presented their research findings at conferences and professional meetings nationwide. If you are invited to present at an off-campus venue, you may apply to the Hamel Center for Undergraduate Research for a Research Presentation Grant. These grants support your travel expenses and conference registration fees (not including meals, lodging, or trip insurance).  Award amounts vary based on available funds. [Info Here](https://www.unh.edu/undergrad-research/research-presentation-grants).
* [Northeastern Association of Marine and Great Lakes Laboratories Travel Grant](http://neamgll.naml.org/members/studentsupport.php) Helps fund travel for NE marine research.
