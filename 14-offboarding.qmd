# Offboarding {#offboarding}

Here is a brief summary of the offboarding process (but it looks slightly different for different positions).

-   Ensure that all data (including raw data sheets) and code is available in a public repository or in the QuantMarineEcoLab Github, and Sharepoint folders
-   Ensure that your data (if applicable) has appropriate metadata (e.g., describing columns in your data) <https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/about>
-   Develop a plan for next steps (if appropriate) for your project in collaboration with your mentor and Easton
-   Return any lab equipment (e.g., books, computer, computer accessories, field equipment)
-   Return office keys to Easton or the department
-   Complete a progress assessment form <https://unh.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8B3OVWv6ZvPofcy>
-   (Can take the form of a CV) Compile a list (of activities during your time in the lab) of all your grants awarded, publications submitted and accepted, classes taught, and outreach activities (this can be take from your previous progress updates)
-   Set up an exit interview with your direct mentor and/or Easton

## Exit interview

- Knowledge transfer
   - Document current projects, code, data workflows, protocols 
   - Identify what needs to be handed off and to whom 
   - Schedule handoff meetings for ongoing work 
   - Update lab wiki/Notion/SharePoint with relevant documentation
- Future workplans
   - Review authorship plans for current and upcoming manuscripts 
   - Clarify responsibilities for revisions, final submissions, or grants 
   - Communication approach moving forward

Other questions
- What went well? What could be improved in the lab?
- Reflections on mentorship, collaboration, and culture.
- Career plans + interest in staying connected (e.g., alumni network).
