# Offboarding {#offboarding}

We have a document in the shared Google drive focused on lab
offboarding, the process that describes what happens when someone leaves
the lab. Here is a brief summary of the process.

-   Ensure that all data (including raw data sheets) and code is
    available in a public repository or in the QuantMarineEcoLab Github,
    GoogleDrive, or Sharepoint folders
-   Ensure that your data (if applicable) has appropriate metadata
    (e.g., describing columns in your data)
    <https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/about>
-   Develop a plan for next steps (if appropriate) for your project in
    collaboration with your mentor and Easton
-   Return any lab equipment (e.g., books, computer accessories, field
    equipment)
-   Return office keys to Easton or the department
-   Complete a progress assessment form

-   Compile a list (of activities during your time in the lab) of all
    your grants awarded, publications submitted and accepted, classes
    taught, and outreach activities (this can be take from your previous
    progress updates)
-   Set up an exit interview with your direct mentor and/or Easton
