# Introduction {#intro}


## Essential intent

## QMEL flywheel


## SDGs

In 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. As members of QMEL, we contribute to these goals, especially Quality Education, Life Below Water, and Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.

## Readings

See the next chapter for more detail on our lab culture and philosophy. We are motivated heavily by the following two papers - which provide a blueprint for how we think about the way we do our work:

- Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools [@lowndes2017]
- Good enough practices in scientific computing [@wilson2017]

\[To come: recommended reading list\]






## Shared lab resources

We also share our institutional knowledge through our lab-chat github 'issues' repository. This is a community-driven troubleshooting resource, please contribute!

We maintain a lab Sharepoint folder for lab publications, presentations, photos, CVs, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work.
