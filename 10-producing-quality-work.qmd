# Producing quality work {#producing-quality-work}

For better or worse, publications are a key currency in science. They
are one of the main ways we track scientific progress and individual
production. Authorship on papers can be one of the most fraught topics
and is therefore often ignored until the last minute. This is a bad
strategy and only leads to resentment among co-authors. Therefore,
authorship (in terms of composition and order) should be determined at
the onset of the project. The specifics might change throughout the
project, but it is key to have a starting point to work with from the
start. The term “significant scientific contributions” is often used for
defining who should be included as an author. In this lab, we use the
definition from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
(<http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html>):
The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4
criteria:

-   Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work;
    or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the
    work; AND
-   Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
    intellectual content; AND
-   Final approval of the version to be published; AND
-   Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
    that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of
    the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. In addition,
    “the corresponding author is the one individual who takes primary
    responsibility for communication with the journal during the
    manuscript submission, peer review, and publication process”.

Thus, simply providing some data or providing minor comments on a
manuscript do not warrant authorship, but they should still be
acknowledged. Just because I am your advisor, does not mean I warrant
authorship on your publications. The same goes for your committee
members. There will likely be publications that you are involved with
that I have only a small part in. That being said, the most common order
(but by no means the only) for authorship in the lab is Grad Student
Lead, Other Contributors, with the PI as the last author. It is common
for the grad student lead and the PI to both be corresponding authors.
