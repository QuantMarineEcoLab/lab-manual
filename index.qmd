# Welcome!

Welcome to our book of magical secrets.

<br> This is the lab manual for the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire.\
Our work focuses on how to use quantitative tools to understand marine systems. We have three core lab themes: improving environmental monitoring, understanding how ecosystems respond to extreme events, and how to improve environmental data science education. More about our group can be found on our [website](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/){target="_blank"}.

This lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Easton (easton.white\@unh.edu) or make a pull request.

QMEL has had a lab manual since its inception, but we used this template from the Fay Lab starting in 2025. They built it as part of the [Openscapes Champions program](https://openscapes.org){target="_blank"}.\
