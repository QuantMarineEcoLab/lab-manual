# Onboarding {#onboarding}

Welcome to QMEL and the University of New Hampshire!

![](img/forestgump.gif)

Here are some resources to help you get settled into the Lab.  

Our group is excited that you have decided to join our team! We hope that these onboarding resources, guidelines, and tips will make your transition to QMEL and UNH seamless and enjoyable. Most importantly, welcome!  

If you are already a student, post-doc, or researcher we hope these resources prove useful as well.  

## First steps

In addition to reading through this lab manual, all lab members should verify they have completed the following lab onboarding steps:

- If needed, submit I-9 paperwork and direct deposit paperwork
- Request access to the [QMEL Sharepoint folder](https://universitysystemnh.sharepoint.com/teams/QuantMarineEcologyLab/SitePages/ProjectHome.aspx)
- Request to join the lab Slack group
- Request to join the Department of Biological Sciences Slack group (grad students and postdocs only)
- Create a [Github account](https://github.com/) and request push access (by asking Easton) to the [lab Github account](https://github.com/QuantMarineEcoLab).
- Add or update your [biography on the lab website](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/team/) - can email Easton with bio and headshot. 
- Obtain keys from Lisa for both your personal office and the lab space if applicable

## Core readings

Before starting in the lab, there are several good resources you might consider reading to ease your transition. Feel free to ask Easton or others in the lab what resources they found the most helpful. It will certainly depend on your career stage. We also have hard copies for many of these resources in the lab library. In addition to this lab manual, we also follow the mentee-mentor compact from the [Association of American Medical Colleges](https://store.aamc.org/downloadable/download/sample/sample_id/99/).
