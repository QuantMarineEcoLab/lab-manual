Here are some resources to help you get settled into the Lab.  

Our group is excited that you have decided to join our team! We hope that these onboarding resources, guidelines, and tips will make your transition to SMAST seamless and enjoyable. Most importantly, welcome!  

If you are already a student, post-doc, or researcher we hope these resources prove useful as well.  

## First steps



In addition to the lab manual, all lab members should verify they have completed the following lab onboarding steps:

- Request access to the QMEL Google Drive and Sharepoint folders
- Request to join the lab Slack group. This may also involve joining the Department of Biological Sciences Slack group
- Join related listserves (links TBD)
- If needed, submit I-9 paperwork and direct deposit paperwork
- Add or update your biography on the lab website
- Obtain keys from Lisa for both your personal office and the lab space
